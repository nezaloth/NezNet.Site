          <h1><b>My Collection</b></h1>
          <p>My personal collection of bones, insects, shells, sponges, rocks and more! All digitized and archived for your viewing pleasure.</p>
          <p>Unless specified otherwise all specimens are collected from the east coast of the New Zealand south island. Locations are intentionally kept vague to protect my identity, if you would like to ask where exactly a specimen was collected from, or if you have any curious questions please contact me via my email: <a href="mailto:Nezaloth@protonmail.com">Nezaloth@protonmail.com</a>.</p>
          <p>Please note that this archive is by no means complete, as I have far to many specimens than would be practical to digitize.</p>

          <h2><b>Rocks</b></h2>
          <p>My rock collection started in early 2023 and has since grown a little out of hand, with rocks piling up in excessive numbers and already becoming difficult to relocate after only a year.</p>
          <p>For the sake of simplicity I have decided to exclude fossils from this section and instead keep them with their respective animal phyla.</p>
