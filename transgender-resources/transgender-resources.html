<h1><b>Transgender Resources</b></h1>
<p>Being trans can be extremely confusing and difficult, the lack of resources and conflicting online information makes researching and finding things out an awfully complicated process.</p>
<p>This page aims to be a central hub for knowledge on a variety of different transgender topics, detailing makeup to hormones, tucking to voice training.</p>
<p>Please be aware that, being human I am prone to bias and as someone who is MtF my knowledge transitioning FtM is somewhat limited. Although in order to mitigate this I will try to support my writing with peer reviewed papers as often as possible.</p>
<p>Lastly, feel free to email me if you have any suggestions/recommendations to add to this page.</p>

<h2><b>There's a lot of information here, to be trans do I have to listen to all of it?</b></h2>
<p>The short answer is no, you don't need to follow all the guides here to be trans. You don't need to tuck or undergow HRT, etc to be accepted as transgender. No matter what stage you are at in your transition you're always valid!</p>
