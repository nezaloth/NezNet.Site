          <p>A list of definitions for common terminology used in queer spaces.</p>

          <h2><b>LGBTQIA+</b></h2>
          <p>The acronym used to refer to the queer community, stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex and asexual with the plus representing less common identities. Occasionally shortened to LGBTQ.</p>

        <section class="half">
          <h2><b>Queer</b></h2>
          <p>A catch all term used to describe the many different sexualities and gender identities. Used to be considered offensive until recently, as it has been reclaimed and endorsed by the community.</p>

        <section class="full">
          <h1><b>Cisgender</b></h1>
          <p>People whose gender identity matches the one they are assigned by their sex at birth, fitting within a male/female gender binary. Often abbreviated into a shortened form of the word "cis".</p>
        </section>

        <section class="twothird">
          <h2><b>Transgender</b></h2>
          <p>People (like me :3) whose gender identity does not match the one determined by their assigned sex at birth. In my case I was born male and raised like a boy, but I now see myself and consider myself a girl. Although this is only one such example as there are many different identities that transgender people can identify with. Additionally in conversation it is not uncommon to hear the term transgender be shortened to just the word "trans".</p>

        <section class="third">
          <h2><b>MtF/FtM</b></h2>
          <p>Acronyms used among trans communities to respectively shorten the phrases "male to female" and "female to male", although it should be noted that many trans identities exist outside of these two.</p>

        <section class="full">
        <h1><b>Non-binary</b></h1>
        <p>People whose gender identity exists outside of the male/female gender binary. For example people who see their gender as between, or as a mix of male and female, or seen as something disconnected to the two. Can by seen shortened to NB or converted into the phrase "enby".</p>
